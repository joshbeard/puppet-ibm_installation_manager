#
# Type for interfacing with IBM's Installation Manager.  See the 'imcl'
# provider for more detailed notes.
#
# Basically, we could almost make a package provider for this instead, but we
# need to be able to support all sorts of scenarios that I'm not sure the
# package resource supports.  We can install the same version multiple times
# on a system, for instance, but to different paths.  The source is also
# tricky.  The source is a massive download from IBM that's extracted in a
# certain way.  It includes a 'repository.config' file that the
# Installation Manager tool parses for details on what software is available
# to be installed.
